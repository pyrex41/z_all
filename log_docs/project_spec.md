# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary
The Zapier Triggers API is a new, unified system designed to enable real-time, event-driven automation on the Zapier platform. It will provide a public, reliable, and developer-friendly RESTful interface for any system to send events into Zapier. This innovation will empower users to create agentic workflows, allowing systems to react to events in real time rather than relying solely on scheduled or manual triggers. By implementing the Triggers API, Zapier will lay the groundwork for the next generation of automation and agent frameworks.

## 2. Problem Statement
Currently, triggers in Zapier are defined within individual integrations, limiting flexibility and scalability. The lack of a centralized mechanism to accept and process events from diverse sources restricts the platform's ability to support real-time, event-driven workflows. The introduction of a unified Triggers API will resolve these limitations by providing a standardized method for systems to send and manage events efficiently, thereby enhancing Zapier's automation capabilities.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics
- **Goal:** Develop a working prototype of the Triggers API that can reliably ingest, store, and deliver events.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Successful ingestion of events from external sources with a 99.9% reliability rate.
  - Reduction of latency in event processing by 50% compared to existing integrations.
  - Positive developer feedback on ease of use and integration, measured through surveys.
  - Adoption by at least 10% of existing Zapier integrations within the first six months.

## 4. Target Users & Personas
- **Developers**: Need a straightforward, reliable API to integrate their systems with Zapier for real-time event processing.
- **Automation Specialists**: Require tools to build complex workflows that react to external events without manual intervention.
- **Business Analysts**: Seek insights from real-time data to drive decision-making and process improvements.

## 5. User Stories
1. **As a Developer,** I want to send events to Zapier via a RESTful API so that I can integrate my application with minimal effort.
2. **As an Automation Specialist,** I want to create workflows that automatically react to incoming events so that I can streamline business processes.
3. **As a Business Analyst,** I want to access real-time event data so that I can analyze trends and optimize operations.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### P0: Must-have
- **Event Ingestion Endpoint (/events):**
  - Accept POST requests with JSON payloads.
  - Store events with metadata (ID, timestamp, payload contents).
  - Return a structured acknowledgment upon successful ingestion.

- **Event Persistence and Delivery:**
  - Store events durably.
  - Provide a /inbox endpoint to list or retrieve undelivered events.
  - Implement acknowledgment or deletion flow once events are consumed.

### P1: Should-have
- **Developer Experience Enhancements:**
  - Clear and predictable API routes and responses.
  - Basic retry logic or status tracking for event delivery.

### P2: Nice-to-have
- **Documentation and Example Client:**
  - Minimal documentation and a sample client to demonstrate ease of use.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** High availability with low latency (target < 100ms response time for event ingestion).
- **Security:** Ensure secure data transmission and storage, including authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Scalability:** Support for high volume of events with horizontal scalability on AWS.
- **Compliance:** Adherence to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

## 8. User Experience & Design Considerations
- Ensure intuitive API design with comprehensive error messages.
- Provide clear guidelines and documentation for developers.
- Ensure accessibility for all interfaces, with considerations for diverse developer needs.

## 9. Technical Requirements
- **System Architecture:**
  - RESTful API built with Python, deployed on AWS.
  - Use of AWS services for storage and event processing.

- **Integrations:**
  - Open-source tools for testing and validation.
  - Mock data sources for development purposes.

- **Data Requirements:**
  - JSON schema for event data, with sample payloads.

## 10. Dependencies & Assumptions
- Reliance on AWS infrastructure for deployment and scaling.
- Assumption of developer familiarity with RESTful APIs and JSON.

## 11. Out of Scope
- Advanced event filtering and transformation features.
- Comprehensive analytics and reporting tools.
- Long-term data retention strategies (beyond MVP needs).

This PRD serves as a guiding document for the development and implementation of the Zapier Triggers API, aligning cross-functional stakeholders and enabling independent execution. All specifications are designed to be actionable using publicly available resources and tools.
