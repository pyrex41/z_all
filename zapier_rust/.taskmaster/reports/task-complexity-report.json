			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard Rust project initialization, dependency management, and basic scaffolding, which are straightforward with Cargo and Axum. Implementation effort is low due to familiarity with Rust ecosystem, minimal technical challenges, no complex dependencies, and simple testing via build and health check. No expansion needed as it's a single, cohesive setup step."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema and Migrations",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the database schema implementation into subtasks for each table (organizations, events, event_deliveries, deduplication_cache), including defining indexes, constraints, and migration scripts, then integrate connection pool and startup migrations.",
			"reasoning": "Defining PostgreSQL schema with SQLx involves moderate effort for accurate table structures, indexes, and compile-time queries. Technical challenges include ensuring schema compatibility with PRD and handling migrations. Depends on project setup, and testing requires a test DB instance. Recommended subtasks to handle each table separately for clarity."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Core API Endpoints Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for each endpoint: one for POST /api/events (focusing on zero-copy ingestion and deduplication), one for GET /api/inbox (with pagination), one for POST /api/ack/:event_id, one for POST /api/webhook/config, one for POST /api/keys/generate, one for GET /api/keys, one for POST /api/keys/rotate, and one for GET /health.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing multiple endpoints with complex logic like zero-copy, transactions, and error handling requires significant effort. High technical challenges in performance optimization and JSON handling. Depends on DB schema, extensive testing including unit, integration, and parity checks. Subtasks per endpoint allow focused development and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Authentication Middleware",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks: one for implementing the AuthenticatedOrg extractor with Argon2 hashing and DB queries, and another for integrating rate limiting based on tiers and applying middleware to routes.",
			"reasoning": "Security-critical middleware with hashing and rate limiting poses moderate challenges in constant-time comparisons and performance. Depends on DB and API endpoints. Testing involves security audits and benchmarks. Two subtasks cover the core components without overcomplicating."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Delivery Worker Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks: one for setting up the Tokio task and channel for event notifications, one for implementing batch fetching and parallel processing with reqwest, and one for handling retries, exponential backoff, and DLQ logic.",
			"reasoning": "Async worker with parallel processing, retries, and backoff requires careful concurrency handling. High effort due to potential deadlocks and performance tuning. Depends on API and auth. Comprehensive testing including load tests. Three subtasks align with key functional areas."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Rate Limiting and Security Enhancements",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks: one for tiered rate limiting middleware, one for HTTPS enforcement and HSTS, one for CORS configuration, and one for additional security measures like API key rotation and constant-time checks.",
			"reasoning": "Security enhancements build on existing middleware, with moderate effort for configuration and audits. Technical challenges in penetration testing. Depends on auth. Testing includes simulations and audits. Four subtasks for distinct security layers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Observability Setup",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: one for integrating Prometheus metrics and RED metrics, one for structured logging with tracing-subscriber, and one for OpenTelemetry tracing and span configuration.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up metrics, logging, and tracing involves integration with crates, moderate effort. Challenges in ensuring configurable levels and distributed tracing. Depends on worker. Testing via endpoints and tools. Three subtasks for each observability pillar."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Testing and Benchmarking",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into: one for unit tests on handlers and workers, one for integration tests on the full stack, one for load tests and benchmarking with drill, and one for property-based tests and CI/CD integration.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing suite requires high effort for coverage, property-based tests, and load simulations. Technical challenges in achieving targets and parity. Depends on multiple prior tasks. Extensive testing strategy. Four subtasks cover test types."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Deployment Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks: one for creating the multi-stage Dockerfile, one for Kubernetes manifests, one for Fly.io and AWS Lambda configs, and one for GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline setup.",
			"reasoning": "Configuring multiple deployment options with size and performance constraints involves moderate effort. Challenges in optimizing for cold starts and scaling. Depends on testing. Testing via deployments. Four subtasks for each platform."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimizations and Profiling",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: one for applying zero-copy and SIMD techniques, one for enabling LTO and PGO in Cargo, one for profiling with perf/flamegraph, one for optimizing hot paths, and one for verifying memory/CPU targets.",
			"reasoning": "Advanced optimizations like PGO and profiling demand high expertise and iterative effort. Significant challenges in meeting strict performance targets. Depends on testing and deployment. Rigorous benchmarking. Five subtasks for phased optimization."
