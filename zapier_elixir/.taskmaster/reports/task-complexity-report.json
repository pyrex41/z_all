			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Elixir/Phoenix project with dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into subtasks for dependency installation, configuration files setup, and supervision tree implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard Phoenix project initialization with multiple dependencies and environment configurations, requiring moderate effort in setup and basic OTP knowledge, but it's foundational and not highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design and implement database schemas with Ecto",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for defining Ecto schemas with fields and validations, and creating migrations with indexes.",
			"reasoning": "Involves Ecto schema design, migrations, and database optimizations like indexes and JSONB handling, which require good understanding of Ecto and PostgreSQL, leading to moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement authentication and security features",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for creating the authentication Plug, implementing CORS and TLS configurations, and ensuring log security.",
			"reasoning": "Security-critical task with hashing, header validation, and HTTPS enforcement, involving multiple integrations and potential edge cases, increasing complexity due to security implications and testing needs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement rate limiting and deduplication",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into subtasks for integrating Hammer for rate limiting and implementing deduplication logic with caching.",
			"reasoning": "Requires integrating third-party libraries like Hammer and Cachex, handling concurrency and error responses, with load testing challenges, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create POST /events ingestion endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks for parameter parsing and validation, applying auth/rate/dedup checks, database insertion with transactions, and job queuing.",
			"reasoning": "Core endpoint tying together multiple features (auth, rate limiting, dedup, DB, queuing), with error handling and transactions, demanding high integration effort and thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Oban job queue for delivery",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Focus on a single subtask for configuring Oban in the supervision tree and defining queue settings with retry policies.",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward Oban configuration with Postgres backend and retry logic, but requires understanding of job queues and supervision, resulting in moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Delivery Worker for webhook posting",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for defining the worker perform function, handling HTTP requests with retries, and updating delivery statuses.",
			"reasoning": "Involves asynchronous job processing, HTTP interactions, retry logic, and database updates, with integration testing needs, raising complexity due to reliability requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement GET /inbox and POST /ack management endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for the GET /inbox endpoint with pagination and the POST /ack endpoint with bulk updates.",
			"reasoning": "Requires efficient querying, pagination, and idempotent updates, with API testing, but manageable as two distinct endpoints with moderate query optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build dashboard with Phoenix LiveView",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for key management forms, event history views, retry functionality, export features, and API documentation integration.",
			"reasoning": "Involves building a full interactive UI with real-time updates, multiple components, and integrations, demanding frontend expertise, extensive testing, and high effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add monitoring, logging, and deployment setup",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks for setting up logging and telemetry, configuring Prometheus metrics, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure provisioning.",
			"reasoning": "Encompasses observability, deployment automation, and infrastructure, requiring knowledge of multiple tools and environments, with end-to-end testing, leading to high complexity."
