			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This task involves basic project initialization with ASDF, Quicklisp, and directory setup, which is straightforward with no major technical challenges or dependencies beyond standard Lisp tooling. Testing is simple verification of loading."

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: 1) Create and test the SQL schema file with tables and indexes; 2) Implement and test the database connection module with pooling and environment variable handling.",
			"reasoning": "Involves SQL schema design, connection pooling with Postmodern, and integration with environment variables. Moderate effort due to database setup and testing under load, with dependencies on task 1."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Woo server basic setup",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks: 1) Set up the Lack middleware stack with basic components; 2) Configure Woo server with routing and clustering; 3) Integrate event-driven architecture with libev and test basic connectivity.",
			"reasoning": "Requires configuring multiple middleware (accesslog, CORS, etc.), server clustering, and event-driven setup. High complexity due to integration of several libraries and production-ready features like multi-worker support."

			"taskTitle": "Implement health check endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Simple endpoint implementation with DB connectivity check and JSON response. Low effort, depends on server and DB setup, with straightforward testing for response time."

			"taskTitle": "Implement API key management endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks: 1) Implement key generation and storage in the organizations model; 2) Create and test the endpoints for generating and retrieving keys with tier support.",
			"reasoning": "Involves UUID generation, DB storage, and endpoint creation with tier-based logic. Moderate complexity due to thread-safety and integration with auth/rate limiting."

			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement event retrieval (inbox) endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks: 1) Implement filtering and pagination logic in the query; 2) Create the endpoint with JSON response and metadata handling.",
			"reasoning": "Requires DB queries with filters, pagination, and JSON serialization. Moderate effort due to query optimization and testing various parameter combinations."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement event acknowledgment endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward update operation with ownership validation. Low complexity, builds on existing event and auth infrastructure."

			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtask: Integrate the middleware into the Lack stack and test with protected endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "Involves creating Lack middleware for API key validation and context setting. Moderate due to integration with DB and middleware chain."

			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks: 1) Implement the rate limiting algorithm (e.g., token bucket) with tier support; 2) Ensure thread-safety and integrate with middleware stack.",
			"reasoning": "Requires algorithm implementation, in-memory storage, thread-safety with bordeaux-threads, and per-tier logic. Higher complexity for performance and correctness under load."

			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtask: Add validation for URL and optional configs, then store in DB.",
			"reasoning": "Endpoint for storing configs with validation. Moderate effort, similar to other CRUD endpoints, with focus on URL validation."
