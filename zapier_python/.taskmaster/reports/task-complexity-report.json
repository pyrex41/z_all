		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up project infrastructure and database schema",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into subtasks covering project initialization with UV, dependency configuration, infrastructure provisioning with Terraform, database schema definition and migrations, and local development setup with Docker Compose.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple components including project setup, infrastructure provisioning across cloud services, database schema design with partitioning and indexing, and integration with tools like Alembic and Docker. It requires coordination of various technologies (UV, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Terraform), has high implementation effort due to the breadth of setup, and includes testing for database operations, making it complex with potential for errors in infra provisioning."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement authentication and security",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for API key generation and hashing, middleware implementation for authentication and rate limiting, and security configurations including CORS and encryption.",
			"reasoning": "Involves cryptographic operations (bcrypt hashing), middleware development for FastAPI, tiered rate limiting with Redis, and security best practices. It builds on infrastructure setup, requires careful handling of sensitive data, and includes comprehensive testing for security vulnerabilities, adding to the technical challenges and effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement POST /events endpoint for event ingestion",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for endpoint definition and validation, deduplication logic with Redis, rate limiting integration, database transactions and queuing, and performance optimization for low latency.",
			"reasoning": "Core endpoint with strict performance requirements (<100ms p95), involving validation, deduplication, rate limiting, transactional DB inserts, and Redis queuing. Depends on auth and infra, requires handling large payloads, and extensive load testing, making it highly complex due to concurrency and scalability needs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement GET /inbox endpoint for retrieving undelivered events",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for endpoint implementation with pagination and filtering, and query optimization with database indexes.",
			"reasoning": "Focuses on efficient paginated queries and filtering in PostgreSQL, building on prior endpoints. Moderate complexity due to pagination logic and performance under load, but less involved than ingestion with fewer moving parts and dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement POST /ack endpoint for acknowledging delivered events",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for batch acknowledgment logic and database transaction handling.",
			"reasoning": "Involves batch processing up to 1K IDs with idempotency and transactional updates. Depends on inbox endpoint, requires consistency checks, but relatively straightforward compared to other endpoints, with moderate testing for batch operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop delivery worker for webhook posting",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for Redis Streams consumer implementation, webhook posting with retry logic and exponential backoff, error handling and logging, horizontal scaling setup, and performance testing for throughput.",
			"reasoning": "Background worker with asynchronous processing, Redis Streams for queuing, retry mechanisms, and high throughput targets (1K+/sec). Involves concurrency, network calls to external webhooks, and scaling, with significant testing for reliability and performance, making it one of the most complex due to distributed system challenges."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Add monitoring, logging, and observability",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for integrating Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and dashboards, setting up structured logging and OTEL tracing, and configuring alerts.",
			"reasoning": "Requires integration of multiple observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, OTEL), structured logging with retention policies, and alert setup. Builds on infrastructure, involves GDPR compliance, and needs manual verification, adding moderate complexity in configuration and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build dashboard and UI for management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for UI routes and templates with htmx, key management and webhook configuration features, event history and retry functionalities, and export capabilities with pagination.",
			"reasoning": "Involves building a full web UI with multiple features (key management, testing, logs, exports) using htmx and FastAPI templates. Depends on many prior tasks, requires UI testing and backend integration, with moderate complexity in frontend-backend coordination and user experience design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement documentation and OpenAPI specs",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for generating OpenAPI specs and adding custom documentation pages with examples.",
			"reasoning": "Leverages FastAPI's auto-generation for OpenAPI, with added custom docs and examples. Low effort as it's mostly configuration, depends on endpoints, and involves minimal testing, making it the least complex task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Set up CI/CD, deployment, and testing pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for configuring GitHub Actions with UV for testing and linting, setting up deployment pipelines to staging and production, and optimizing Docker builds with UV caching.",
			"reasoning": "Involves CI/CD setup with multiple stages (testing, deployment), integration with UV for dependency management, Terraform for infra, and end-to-end testing. Builds on infra and monitoring, requires pipeline reliability and parity checks, adding moderate complexity in automation and cloud migrations."
